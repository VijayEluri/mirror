[chapter Proxy]

Release 1.6 added a new feature to Mirror. The ability to create proxys of classes and interfaces.

[java]
SomeClass proxy = new Mirror().proxify(SomeClass.class)
		.interceptingWith(new YourCustomMethodInterceptor());
[/java]

The method ::interceptingWith:: receives any number of objects that implement 
::net.vidageek.mirror.proxy.dsl.MethodInterceptor::. These are called one after another until one of them
accepts intercepting the invoked method.
