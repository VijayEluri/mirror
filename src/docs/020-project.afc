[chapter Project]

Mirror is a simple DSL layer over Java Reflection API, designed to make the use
of this powerful a lot tool easier. Forget about thousands of exceptions thrown
at your face. Forget about those completely unreadable lines of code. 

Simplicity is really powerful too.

Mirror project started around June 2008, implementing something close to the 
idea gave by a great programmer, Nico Steppat (http://www.caelum.com.br), when
asked how to remove that ugly static-full ReflectionUtil from the code base of a
project we were working at.

[section Versioning]

Mirror uses a simple versioning system:

mirror-A.B.C.jar

[list]
* C - Critical bug resolutions.
* B - Feature added + bug resolutions.
* A - Tons of features or API change.
[/list]

Since Mirror is a DSL, any changes to the DSL itself is assumed to be an API change. The underneath objects that formerly provided the changed feature will not be considered.
